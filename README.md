# CodinGame Ghost in the Cell contest submissions
These are my [CodinGame Ghost in the Cell](https://www.codingame.com/contests/ghost-in-the-cell) submissions which I created during the contest. I started with Java, but quickly switched to Javascript which gave me some new ideas and strategies along the way of moving from Java to Javascript. I attempted to do some stuff with Bash too, but it didn't go so well. After that I switched back to Javascript and adjusted it a bit more, and submitted the code in the Javascript directory for my final submission. It ended on rank 811/3508 in the Gold league.

## Multiple files?
I use multiple files to keep my code organized. The Javascript code was bundled using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), while the Java code was merged using [my own Gulp plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-java-merger).
